            I'm an experienced Fullstack Software Engineer that loves delivering
            technical solutions to customer problems. Currently based in

            I've participated in a variety of projects helping companies
            orchestrate and promote their training. I work with teams to
            architect and deliver solutions across the stack, from the
            underlying infrastructure to the UI, with a soft spot for building
            robust, clean APIs.

            I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my horizons,
            challenge myself and learn about new technologies.
