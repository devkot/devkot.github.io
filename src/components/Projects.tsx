                    5G. I believe 5G is opening lots of doors for accomodating
                    the ever growing number of IoT devices that can have a
                    positive impact in our daily lives, such as health metric
                    sensors for example. Despite being a code geek, I'm still
                    fascinated by Networks and its advancements, like Software
                    Defined Networks. The endless options of this next
                    generation tech also inspired my thesis on "Network Caching
                    for 5G Systems".
