            Hi, I'm Stelios! This is a space for me to present my professional
            and personal interests and also spill my thoughts. I'm passionate
            about Software Engineering, traveling, photography and pushing my
            curiosity's limits.

            This project is a result of a goal I had in 2020, to create a
            portfolio website to display my coding projects, and to create a
            personal website where I could post about all kinds of things I find
            fascinating. As such, this website kind of blends the personal and
            the professional as I believe they're an interweaved aspect of our
            lives.
          </Box>
          <Box className={classes.boxText}>
            Generally, I have quite a diverse set of interests, so I hope you
            can get something out of this, be it getting to know me or simply
            hearing what I'm currently up to!
